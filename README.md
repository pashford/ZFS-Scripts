# ZFS-Scripts

Upon review, it appears to me that the ZED (ZFS Event Daemon) tool has made many of these scripts unnecessary.  In addition, the Sanoid tool (https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid) has made the snapshot script unnecessary.

As a result of the above, a tag of **Pre-0.7** has been added.  To access the old scripts, use that tag.  The remaining current scripts will be available as normal.
